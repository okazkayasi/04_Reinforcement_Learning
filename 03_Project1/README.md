# PROJECT 1

In this project, Sutton's TD Learning algorithms, stated in "Learning to Predict by the Methods of Temporal Learning" paper, are implemented and some figures in the paper are recreated.

I have used Python 2.7 and ipython notebooks. A clean virtual env is created using conda. The packages needed are written in requirements.txt and can be installed using pip.

The packages downloaded after clean virtual env is created are

- numpy=1.15.2
- matplotlib=2.2.3

Each figure created has its own ipython file, but all uses the same random seed, so that they use the same training data.

For the figure 3 (first experiment), you will see more than one graph is created. This is to show the difference that is caused by different learning rates.
